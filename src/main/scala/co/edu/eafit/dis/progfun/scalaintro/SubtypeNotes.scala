  // Subtyping!
  // Subtyping is a very important concept in programming languages.
  // It is so, that there is one SOLID principle dedicated
  // just to provide the correct definition of subtyping.
  // L in SOLID stands for: Liskov substitution principle:
  // "objects in a program should be replaceable with instances
  // of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program".
  // In Scala for simple types, subtyping is the same as sub-classing,
  // that means that if A extends B then A is a subtype of B (A <: B).
  // Additionally, it is important to note that for every type in Scala:
  //   * It is a subtype, and also a sub-class, of Any.
  //   * It is a supertype, but not a super-class, of Nothing.
  // Also for any reference type, namely a type that is not a primitive
  // and is defined by a class, trait or object, we can say that:
  //   * It is a subtype, and also a sub-class, of AnyRef.
  //     This is the equivalent of java.lang.Object, AnyRef <: Any.
  //   * It is a supertype, but not a super-class, of Null.
  //     There is only one instance of Null and it is null,
  //     it is the same null as from java, Nothing <: Null.

  //       instead of MutableBox, the code will compile and fail in runtime.

  // At first glance it might seems like the use of the P generic
  // and the type bound is unnecessary, since we can just say that
  // the pet argument to be of type Pet.
  // However, there is a big advantage of using the the P generic
  // and it is that the pet value does not forget what is its type.
  // Thus, when accessing it again we can safely store it in a variable
  // of type Dog, which could not be done if it were upcasted to Pet.

  // Lower type bounds!
  // As the name suggest, these are used to limit the generic parameter
  // to be a supertype of other type.
  // At first it seems that it is not useful at all,
  // however it does has its utility when used together with other type parameters.
  // For example, lets add a :: method to our List, that allows us to prepend
  // and element to the List.
  // At first we may think we could just write `def ::(elem: A): List[A]`
  // "However, this program does not compile, because the parameter elem in :: is of type A,
  // which we declared covariant. This doesnâ€™t work because functions are
  // contravariant in their parameter types and covariant in their result types.
  // To fix this, we need to flip the variance of the type of the parameter element in add,
  // we do this by introducing a new type parameter B that has A as a lower type bound".
  //  - Reference: https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/lower-type-bounds.html
  // In a more intuitive way, if you add something to a List, then:
  //   * It must be an A - in this case the List is still a List[A].
  //   * Or it must be any subtype of A - in this case
  //     the element gets upcasted to A, and the List remains a List[A].
  //   * Or if it is another type B, which must be a supertype of A - in this case
  //     the List gets upcasted to a List[B].
  //     Note: Because Any is just a supertype of everything,
  //           in the worst case the List will be upcasted to List[Any].

  //   * Subtype constraint, A <:< B, proves that A is a subtype of B.
  //   * Sametype constraint, A =:= B, proves that A is the same type as B.
